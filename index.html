            <h3>How TS got started!</h3>
            
    <p> Call Of Duty Trickshoting started way back In COD 4, where there was bounces and not much to do as the games kept coming out people started to find creative shots and then the trickshotting started to get bigger when Bo2 came out as there was a lot to do in that game. Many people started to creat clans and many of them became big like Faze clan one of the first trickshotting clans out there. Faze caln got big off Mw2 or Modern Warfare 2, their standards back then are not the same anymore to get in you kind of have to be a content creator because of many kids playing and doing the same things the other people are doing like feeding and trickshotting you kinda want to be creative in order to get their attention.    </p>

            <h3>How to get better </h3>
        
            <p>Ive been trickshoting since Mw2 as well but its honestly easy once you learn how to play claw or stretch eaithe one at first you wont be able to do anything but once you start to get the hang of it you'll be able to do a lot. I used to play a lot of private match and practice there i still do but not as much because I already know how to do it. It didn't take me a lot of time since I have done it before.  </p>

            <h4>Why is this a fanpage?! </h4>
    <p>I don't think this is a fanpage but I just wanted to do this because I know a lot about this and I can explain what to do and how you do it. </p>
