            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            
            <p>Hi, my name is Alejandro Munoz or Alex. And I live in Chicago I like to make people happy whenever they are sad. I also like to make people smile...because being sad isnt good...I dont know how to describe myself because I havent really thought of myself as much im always there for other people and never for myself, But if I were to describe myself I'd say that im a happy person and caring. I dont know what else to say about myself I just know that im a happy person that really likes to help other people feel better about themselves. I like to play a lot of videogames ever since I was a kid I would always get my gameboy and start playing Mario Bros. That's why I picked game design as my major for this year, to learn more about the games and how to create them.   </p>

            <h3>Current Career </h3>
        
            <p>My current carer interest is in game design because as a kid I loved to play video games I actually grew up playing. I would love to creat my own games becasue it seems really fun and I would probably enjoy it a lot!. I would like to learn more about games I would not only play it but I would also learn to creat these games that I played as a child and till this day I still enjoy playing these games. Its always fun to learn new things and explore... you just never know waht best fits you till you actually try it!. </p>
